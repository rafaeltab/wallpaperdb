Welcome to the WallpaperDB documentation! This guide will help you navigate the documentation structure and find what you need.

## Quick Start

**New to the project?** Start here:
1. Read [Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines) - Critical rules (TDD, incremental changes)
2. Review the [Architecture](/docs/architecture) section - How the system is built

**Implementing something?** Go to:
- [Testing Documentation](/docs/testing) - How-to guides for testing
- [Architecture](/docs/architecture) - Patterns and decisions
- [Observability](/docs/observability) - Monitoring and telemetry

## By Role

### AI Agent implementing features

1. Read [Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines) - TDD, incremental changes
2. Follow step-by-step instructions
3. Refer to architecture patterns and decisions
4. Update documentation as you learn

### Developer joining the project

1. Read [Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines) - Workflow and standards
2. Review [Architecture Decisions](/docs/architecture/decisions) - Why things are the way they are
3. Explore [Testing Documentation](/docs/testing) - How testing works
4. Start with a task and follow the guidelines!

## Key Principles (Always Follow)

### 1. Test-First Development
- Write tests BEFORE implementation
- Every change must have tests
- See [Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines)

### 2. Incremental Changes
- Small, focused changes
- NEVER big-bang refactoring
- Test after each increment
- See [Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines)

### 3. Document As You Go
- Update docs when architecture changes
- Create ADRs for architectural choices
- See [Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines)

## Current Status

### Completed
- Ingestor service (production-ready)
- TesterBuilder pattern (exceptional test infrastructure)
- State machine pattern for uploads
- Reconciliation system
- RFC 7807 error handling
- Basic OTEL integration

### In Progress
- Multi-service architecture planning
- Shared packages extraction
- Observability enhancements
- Test infrastructure setup

### Planned
- Service #2 (Media or Thumbnail Extractor)
- Additional enrichment services
- GraphQL gateway

## Common Questions

### Why Fastify instead of NestJS?
See [ADR-001: Fastify over NestJS](/docs/architecture/decisions/fastify-over-nestjs). Migration cost exceeds benefit - current stack is excellent.

### How do I create a new service?
After shared packages are ready, services take ~1 week to build using established patterns.

### What's the testing strategy?
TDD always. Package tests (fast), integration tests (Testcontainers), E2E tests (Docker).
See [Testing Documentation](/docs/testing)
