# Color evaluation: 2026-09-21T19-14-00.182Z-d06fdb5a

[Complete raw measurements and diagnostics](./run.json). Large diagnostic payloads are kept in that artifact instead of duplicated in this report.

## Evidence and interpretation

No combined score or automatic winner. Accuracy, coverage, latency and resource costs remain separate.

Agreement measures recorded preferences on assessed pairs. Missing comparisons remain unassessed; high agreement with low coverage is incomplete evidence. The sensitivity column excludes explicitly uncertain pairs; it does not invent confidence weights.

These development judgments are not independent population samples or a held-out benchmark. Repeated optimization against them can overfit.

Timing describes this harness, corpus, environment and execution path. Local-reference timing excludes search-backend execution. These measurements do not establish performance for 1 million or 100 million wallpapers. Do not compare speed across different execution classes or workloads.

## Method scope and approximation warnings

A method can return rankings while approximating the requested query semantics. Read these declarations beside agreement and coverage; successful execution does not establish that the intended query is implemented.

| Candidate | Declared approximation | Declared limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pixel cutoff: Hard cutoff | No approximation statement supplied | A pixel may contribute to several regions. These are marginal observations, not an exclusive palette; there is no separate outside-color purity penalty. Picked colors use the nearest indexed anchor. Pixel quality is max(0, 1 - OKLab distance / 0.24), with finite support and a configurable admission cutoff. Feather and core-halo percentages are effective coverage weighted by pixel admission; hard-cutoff percentages are literal covered area. Consensus averages independently scored cutoff components. Averaged coverage and quality are display summaries, never the scoring input. Native OpenSearch functions rank globally. Small-corpus timings do not establish million-wallpaper latency. Development judgments are from one observer; new ZIP wallpapers are unjudged. |

## Per-query semantic warnings

No observations available.

## Large-window ranking diagnostic

These accuracy calls use a separate result limit (1000). They help inspect the scoring formula and coverage. Do not pair this agreement with latency measured at the timed result limit (20), especially for approximate retrieval.

| Candidate | Execution | OK / total | Unsupported | Errors | Agreement | Without uncertain pairs | Pair coverage | Image coverage | Eligibility violations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pixel cutoff: Hard cutoff | opensearch | 31/37 | 6 | 0 | 66.4% | 66.5% | 88.3% | 86.5% | 0 |
| Pixel cutoff: Feathered cutoff | opensearch | 31/37 | 6 | 0 | 67.7% | 67.8% | 88.3% | 86.5% | 0 |
| Pixel cutoff: Full core, soft halo | opensearch | 31/37 | 6 | 0 | 67.3% | 67.5% | 88.3% | 86.5% | 0 |
| Pixel cutoff: Multiple cutoffs | opensearch | 31/37 | 6 | 0 | 68.7% | 68.4% | 88.3% | 86.5% | 0 |

## Timed-search accuracy (first measured sample)

This quality view uses the first successful measured search per case at the same result limit (20) as the performance samples. It is not an average across repeated searches; approximate or nondeterministic methods may vary. Repeated raw trial results remain in diagnostics. Missing judged images are unassessed, so agreement must be read alongside pair and image coverage.

| Candidate | Assessed / total cases | Agreement | Without uncertain pairs | Pair coverage | Image coverage | Eligibility violations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pixel cutoff: Hard cutoff | 10/37 | 68.0% | 73.0% | 12.9% | 27.6% | 0 |
| Pixel cutoff: Feathered cutoff | 11/37 | 65.5% | 66.7% | 13.6% | 29.5% | 0 |
| Pixel cutoff: Full core, soft halo | 12/37 | 51.1% | 52.2% | 14.0% | 29.5% | 0 |
| Pixel cutoff: Multiple cutoffs | 8/37 | 58.3% | 60.4% | 12.1% | 26.3% | 0 |

## Measured performance

Setup is measured separately. Latency percentiles pool measured query samples in this workload; inspect case details for slow queries. Warmup, cache control, repetitions and execution metadata are recorded above and below. Small sample counts do not establish stable tail latency.

| Candidate | Execution | Samples | p50 | p95 | Maximum | Failures | Setup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pixel cutoff: Hard cutoff | opensearch | 155 | 3.07 ms | 4.14 ms | 6.12 ms | 0 | 32314.97 ms |
| Pixel cutoff: Feathered cutoff | opensearch | 155 | 3.27 ms | 4.18 ms | 5.46 ms | 0 | 2.57 ms |
| Pixel cutoff: Full core, soft halo | opensearch | 155 | 3.04 ms | 4.18 ms | 4.72 ms | 0 | 3.13 ms |
| Pixel cutoff: Multiple cutoffs | opensearch | 155 | 3.52 ms | 4.37 ms | 6.11 ms | 0 | 2.16 ms |

## Resource observations

Harness CPU covers the measured block, including warmups. Memory values are process snapshots, not isolated candidate peaks; retained allocations from earlier candidates can affect them. Backend resources and index storage remain n/a when unmeasured. Scope and raw values are preserved in diagnostics.

| Candidate | Harness CPU | RSS before | RSS after | Heap used after | Backend CPU | Backend memory | Index store |
