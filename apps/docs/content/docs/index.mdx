Welcome to the WallpaperDB documentation! This guide will help you navigate the documentation structure and find what you need.

## Quick Start

**New to the project?** Start here:
1. Read [Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines) - Critical rules (TDD, incremental changes)
2. Review the [Architecture](/docs/architecture) section - How the system is built

**Implementing something?** Go to:
- [Testing Documentation](/docs/testing) - How-to guides for testing
- [Architecture](/docs/architecture) - Patterns and decisions
- [Observability](/docs/observability) - Monitoring and telemetry

## By Role

### AI Agent implementing features

1. Read [Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines) - TDD, incremental changes
2. Follow step-by-step instructions
3. Refer to architecture patterns and decisions
4. Update documentation as you learn

### Developer joining the project

1. Read [Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines) - Workflow and standards
2. Review [Architecture Decisions](/docs/architecture/decisions) - Why things are the way they are
3. Explore [Testing Documentation](/docs/testing) - How testing works
4. Start with a task and follow the guidelines!

## Key Principles (Always Follow)

### 1. Test-First Development
- Write tests BEFORE implementation
- Every change must have tests
- See [Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines)

### 2. Incremental Changes
- Small, focused changes
- NEVER big-bang refactoring
- Test after each increment
- See [Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines)

### 3. Document As You Go
- Update docs when architecture changes
- Create ADRs for architectural choices
- See [Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines)

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation
- **[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started)** - 10-minute quick start guide
- **[Development Guidelines](/docs/development-guidelines)** - TDD, incremental changes, coding standards
- **[Observability](/docs/observability)** - OpenTelemetry, Grafana LGTM, monitoring

### Guides
- **[Creating New Service](/docs/guides/creating-new-service)** - Step-by-step service creation guide

- **[Rate Limiting](/docs/guides/rate-limiting)** - Redis-based distributed rate limiting
- **[Testing Strategies](/docs/guides/testing-strategies)** - Unit, integration, E2E test organization
- **[Makefile Commands](/docs/guides/makefile-commands)** - Complete command reference
- **[Database Migrations](/docs/guides/database-migrations)** - Drizzle ORM migration workflow

### Architecture
- **[Multi-Service Architecture](/docs/architecture/multi-service)** - Microservices strategy and patterns
- **[Service Registry](/docs/architecture/service-registry)** - Complete service reference
- **[Shared Packages](/docs/architecture/shared-packages)** - Package architecture and integration
- **[ADRs](/docs/architecture/decisions)** - Architectural decision records

### Packages & Services
- **[Packages](/docs/packages)** - Shared packages (core, events, test-utils, testcontainers, url-ipv4-resolver)
- **[Services](/docs/services)** - Ingestor (✅ complete), Media (🚧 in progress), planned services
- **[Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure)** - PostgreSQL, MinIO, NATS, Redis, OpenSearch, Grafana

## Current Status

### Services
- **✅ Ingestor** - Production-ready upload and validation service
- **🚧 Media** - In progress - retrieval and resizing service
- **📋 Planned** - Thumbnail Extractor, Quality Enrichment, Color Enrichment, Tagging, Gateway

### Shared Packages
- **✅ core** - Infrastructure patterns (connections, config, errors, telemetry, health, OpenAPI)
- **✅ events** - Event schemas, publishers, consumers
- **✅ test-utils** - TesterBuilder framework
- **✅ testcontainers** - Custom container implementations
- **✅ url-ipv4-resolver** - URL validation and SSRF prevention

## Common Questions

### Why Fastify instead of NestJS?
See [ADR-001: Fastify over NestJS](/docs/architecture/decisions/001-fastify-over-nestjs). Migration cost exceeds benefit - current stack is excellent.

### How do I create a new service?
See [Guide: Creating New Service](/docs/guides/creating-new-service). Services take ~1 week to build using shared packages and established patterns.

### What's the testing strategy?
See [Guide: Testing Strategies](/docs/guides/testing-strategies). TDD always. Unit tests (fast), integration tests (Testcontainers), E2E tests (Docker)
