# Profile settings UX exploration — throwaway

Question: which layout gives a useful profile overview while keeping editing focused?

Run the existing development stack with `make dev` (after `make infra-start`), sign in,
then open `/web/settings/profile?variant=A` on this worktree's ingress (currently port 8140).
The normal settings screen is unchanged when `variant` is absent. Prototypes are development-only.
Existing authentication and profile reads stay in place; prototype edits stay in memory.

Planned alternatives:

- A — Profile card: compact identity and handle above a biography preview.
- B — Profile preview: a public-profile composition with editing controls on the content.
- C — Editable details: a compact list with clear labels and section boundaries.

All alternatives use dialogs for pictures, biography and previous handles.
Use “Profile handle” in user-facing copy. Show routine refresh only as contextual recovery
in the eventual implementation. The current biography refresh reloads the profile, preserves
unsaved text, updates its concurrency version, and retries embedded wallpaper previews.

Decision: awaiting the user's comparison. No production redesign or PR update is included.
When selected, implement the chosen behavior with TDD and remove this prototype and switcher.
