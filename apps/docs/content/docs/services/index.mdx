description: WallpaperDB microservices architecture and service registry
---

WallpaperDB uses a microservices architecture with specialized services for different aspects of wallpaper processing and delivery. Each service is independently deployable, scalable, and communicates via NATS events.

## Current Services

### Ingestor Service
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Production-ready)

The entry point for wallpapers into the system. Handles file uploads, validation, storage in MinIO, and event publishing for downstream processing.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-part file upload with streaming
- State machine for upload workflow (6 states)
- Content-based deduplication (SHA256)
- Reconciliation system for eventual consistency
- Redis-based rate limiting
- RFC 7807 error handling

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /upload` - Upload a wallpaper
- `GET /health` - Health check with dependency status
- `GET /ready` - Readiness probe

### Media Service
**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS

Retrieval and serving of wallpapers with on-demand resizing and format conversion.

**Key Features:**
- Wallpaper retrieval from MinIO
- On-demand image resizing (Sharp)
- Multiple resize modes (contain, cover, fill)
- CDN-ready caching headers
- Streaming responses for memory efficiency

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /wallpapers/:id` - Retrieve wallpaper with optional resize
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /ready` - Readiness probe

**Query Parameters:**
- `w` - Target width (1-7680)
- `h` - Target height (1-4320)
- `fit` - Resize mode: contain | cover | fill

## Planned Services

The following services are planned as part of the multi-service architecture expansion:

### Thumbnail Extractor
**Status:** 📋 Planned

Generates thumbnails for video wallpapers using FFmpeg.

**Planned Features:**
- Video thumbnail generation at multiple timestamps
- Multiple thumbnail variants (small, medium, large)
- FFmpeg integration
- Batch processing support

**Event-driven:**
- Consumes: `wallpaper.uploaded` (video files)
- Publishes: `wallpaper.thumbnail.generated`

### Quality Enrichment
**Status:** 📋 Planned

Analyzes image quality and assigns quality scores.

**Planned Features:**
- Resolution and sharpness analysis
- Compression artifact detection
- ML-based quality scoring
- Quality tier assignment (low, medium, high, ultra)

**Event-driven:**
- Consumes: `wallpaper.uploaded` (image files)
- Publishes: `wallpaper.quality.analyzed`

### Color Enrichment
**Status:** 📋 Planned

Extracts dominant colors and color palettes from wallpapers.

**Planned Features:**
- Dominant color extraction
- Color palette generation (5-10 colors)
- Color clustering algorithms
- Perceptual color space analysis

**Event-driven:**
- Consumes: `wallpaper.uploaded`
- Publishes: `wallpaper.colors.extracted`

### Tagging Service
**Status:** 📋 Planned

Tag management and assignment for wallpapers.

**Planned Features:**
- Manual tag assignment
- Tag CRUD operations
- Tag hierarchy management
- Search by tags

**API-driven:**
- REST API for tag management
- GraphQL integration

### Gateway
**Status:** 📋 Planned

GraphQL API gateway for unified access to all services.

**Planned Features:**
- GraphQL schema stitching
- Query optimization and caching
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- API analytics

## Service Architecture

### Communication Patterns

**Event-Driven (NATS JetStream):**
- Services publish events when work is complete
- Other services consume events asynchronously
- Enables loose coupling and independent scaling
- Provides durability and replay capabilities

```
Ingestor → wallpaper.uploaded → {
  Media Service (caches metadata)
  Thumbnail Extractor (generates thumbnails)
  Quality Enrichment (analyzes quality)
  Color Enrichment (extracts colors)
}
```

**Synchronous (HTTP/REST):**
- Used for retrieval operations
- Client-facing endpoints
- Service-to-service queries (when needed)

### Service Registry

| Service | Port | Database | S3/MinIO | NATS | Redis | Status |
|---------|------|----------|----------|------|-------|--------|
| Ingestor | 3001 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (publish) | ✓ | ✅ Complete |
| Media | 3002 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (consume) | - | 🚧 In Progress |
| Thumbnail | 3003 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | - | 📋 Planned |
| Quality | 3004 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | - | 📋 Planned |
| Color | 3005 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | - | 📋 Planned |
| Tagging | 3006 | ✓ | - | - | - | 📋 Planned |
| Gateway | 3000 | - | - | - | ✓ | 📋 Planned |

### Shared Infrastructure

All services use:
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary data store
- **MinIO** - S3-compatible object storage
- **NATS JetStream** - Event bus with durability
- **Grafana LGTM** - Observability (traces, metrics, logs)

Selected services use:
- **Redis** - Rate limiting and caching
- **OpenSearch** - Full-text search (future)

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework
- **Fastify** - High-performance HTTP server
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **TSyringe** - Dependency injection

### Shared Packages
- **@wallpaperdb/core** - Connections, config, telemetry, health
- **@wallpaperdb/events** - Event schemas and pub/sub abstractions
- **@wallpaperdb/test-utils** - TesterBuilder pattern for testing

See [Packages](/docs/packages) for complete package documentation.

### Database & Storage
- **Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe PostgreSQL queries
- **AWS SDK v3** - S3/MinIO client
- **IORedis** - Redis client

### Observability
- **OpenTelemetry** - Distributed tracing and metrics
- **Pino** - Structured logging
- **Grafana** - Dashboards and alerting

## Development Workflow

### Running a Service

```bash
# Start infrastructure first
make infra-start

# Run ingestor service
make ingestor-dev

# Run media service
make media-dev

# Run all services
make dev
```

### Testing a Service

```bash
# Test specific service
make ingestor-test
make media-test

# Test all services
make test
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build specific service
make ingestor-build
make media-build

# Build all services
make build
```

## Service Development Timeline
