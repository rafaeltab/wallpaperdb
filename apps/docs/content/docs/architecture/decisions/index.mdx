All major architectural decisions are documented as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records).

## Available ADRs

- [ADR-001: Fastify over NestJS](/docs/architecture/decisions/fastify-over-nestjs) - Framework choice for multi-service architecture

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:

- Choosing between technologies (framework, database, etc.)
- Major architectural patterns (event sourcing, CQRS, etc.)
- Significant deviations from established patterns
- Decisions that affect multiple services

## ADR Format

- **Context**: What problem/decision
- **Decision**: What was chosen
- **Rationale**: Why
- **Alternatives**: What else was considered
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs and implications
