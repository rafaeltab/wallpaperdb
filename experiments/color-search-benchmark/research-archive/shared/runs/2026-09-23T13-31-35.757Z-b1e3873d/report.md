# Color evaluation: 2026-09-23T13-31-35.757Z-b1e3873d

[Complete raw measurements and diagnostics](./run.json). Large diagnostic payloads are kept in that artifact instead of duplicated in this report.

## Evidence and interpretation

No combined score or automatic winner. Accuracy, coverage, latency and resource costs remain separate.

Agreement measures recorded preferences on assessed pairs. Missing comparisons remain unassessed; high agreement with low coverage is incomplete evidence. The sensitivity column excludes explicitly uncertain pairs; it does not invent confidence weights.

These development judgments are not independent population samples or a held-out benchmark. Repeated optimization against them can overfit.

Timing describes this harness, corpus, environment and execution path. Local-reference timing excludes search-backend execution. These measurements do not establish performance for 1 million or 100 million wallpapers. Do not compare speed across different execution classes or workloads.

## Method scope and approximation warnings

A method can return rankings while approximating the requested query semantics. Read these declarations beside agreement and coverage; successful execution does not establish that the intended query is implemented.

| Candidate | Declared approximation | Declared limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All cutoffs: shade-aware + strict hue (256 buckets, all cutoffs, blend 1, concrete-swatches) | No approximation statement supplied | A pixel may contribute to several regions. These are marginal observations, not an exclusive palette; there is no separate outside-color purity penalty. Picked colors use the nearest indexed anchor. A separately measured shade-aware similarity relaxes lightness and partially normalizes chroma for chromatic anchors, with a near-black visibility guard. Neutral anchors retain the original distance. This directional tolerance is provisional. Feather and core-halo percentages are effective coverage weighted by pixel admission; hard-cutoff percentages are literal covered area. Consensus averages independently scored cutoff components. Averaged coverage and quality are display summaries, never the scoring input. OpenSearch ranks globally. Linear quality uses native functions; power quality may use a Painless score function. Small-corpus timings do not establish million-wallpaper latency. A separately indexed hue gate multiplies shade quality: for fully chromatic anchors, full within 10° of OKLab hue, smooth fade to zero at 30°. Near-neutral anchors blend the gate toward 1; neutral anchors retain their original metric. These angles are not HSV/HSL degrees. Fixed experimental tolerances are not population-calibrated. Development judgments are from one observer; new ZIP wallpapers are unjudged. |
| Favorite optimization: fused score | No approximation statement supplied | Retains the saved favorite color measurements, anchor quantization, marginal proportions and lack of an independent outside-color purity penalty. Reproduces the native factor, weight and component float rounding; exact tied-result parity still depends on the OpenSearch/Lucene scorer implementation and is checked experimentally. Scoring remains global and scans eligible documents. Fusing scoring machinery is an execution experiment, not a proven scalability improvement. Development judgments are from one observer; new ZIP wallpapers are unjudged. |
| Favorite optimization: typed specialized score | No approximation statement supplied | Global scoring still visits eligible documents; this is an execution experiment with no indexed score bounds. Retains native float32 weights, area factor, cutoff contribution casts and final sum cast. Real-service equivalence must be verified. Field names, percentages, weights and control values remain parameters. Script source varies only by 1..50 component count, three area modes and four quality kinds: at most 600 structural variants, generated lazily. Many mixed shapes can churn the compilation cache. Retains the favorite’s anchor quantization, marginal overlap and lack of an independent outside-color purity objective. Development judgments are from one observer; new ZIP wallpapers are unjudged. |
| Favorite256: precomputed float utility | No approximation statement supplied | Preserves the favorite256 shade-aware strict-hue measurements, anchors and independently weighted five-cutoff formula at offered presets. Quality influence is restricted to 0, 0.5 or 1; cutoff weighting to 0, 1 or 3; target proportions to multiples of 5%. Other scoring controls retain the saved defaults. Moving per-target sums before query-time averaging changes float32 rounding order. Formula preservation does not mean bitwise score or near-tie order identity. Abstract vibes and named families retain the original single named-feature definition. Overlap is marginal; there is no new palette-purity or accent objective. Every eligible document participates in the OpenSearch ranking, including zero-score documents. There is no candidate retrieval or application reranking. Float32 target utilities and scores; same mathematical formula at supported presets, with changed floating-point grouping. Development judgments are from one observer; new ZIP wallpapers are unjudged. |
| Favorite256: indexed utility, 8-bit | No approximation statement supplied | Preserves the favorite256 shade-aware strict-hue measurements, anchors and independently weighted five-cutoff formula at offered presets. Quality influence is restricted to 0, 0.5 or 1; cutoff weighting to 0, 1 or 3; target proportions to multiples of 5%. Other scoring controls retain the saved defaults. Moving per-target sums before query-time averaging changes float32 rounding order. Formula preservation does not mean bitwise score or near-tie order identity. Abstract vibes and named families retain the original single named-feature definition. Overlap is marginal; there is no new palette-purity or accent objective. Every eligible document participates in the OpenSearch ranking, including zero-score documents. There is no candidate retrieval or application reranking. Maximum absolute target utility rounding error 1/510, before query float32 arithmetic. Positive integers 1..255 are exactly representable in Lucene rank features. Development judgments are from one observer; new ZIP wallpapers are unjudged. |
| Favorite256: indexed utility, split 16-bit | No approximation statement supplied | Preserves the favorite256 shade-aware strict-hue measurements, anchors and independently weighted five-cutoff formula at offered presets. Quality influence is restricted to 0, 0.5 or 1; cutoff weighting to 0, 1 or 3; target proportions to multiples of 5%. Other scoring controls retain the saved defaults. Moving per-target sums before query-time averaging changes float32 rounding order. Formula preservation does not mean bitwise score or near-tie order identity. Abstract vibes and named families retain the original single named-feature definition. Overlap is marginal; there is no new palette-purity or accent objective. Every eligible document participates in the OpenSearch ranking, including zero-score documents. There is no candidate retrieval or application reranking. Maximum absolute target utility rounding error 1/131070, before query float32 arithmetic. Both positive base256 digits are exactly representable. Development judgments are from one observer; new ZIP wallpapers are unjudged. |
| Favorite256: indexed utility, native precision | No approximation statement supplied | Preserves the favorite256 shade-aware strict-hue measurements, anchors and independently weighted five-cutoff formula at offered presets. Quality influence is restricted to 0, 0.5 or 1; cutoff weighting to 0, 1 or 3; target proportions to multiples of 5%. Other scoring controls retain the saved defaults. Moving per-target sums before query-time averaging changes float32 rounding order. Formula preservation does not mean bitwise score or near-tie order identity. Abstract vibes and named families retain the original single named-feature definition. Overlap is marginal; there is no new palette-purity or accent objective. Every eligible document participates in the OpenSearch ranking, including zero-score documents. There is no candidate retrieval or application reranking. Native rank-feature precision truncates float32 values to nine significant bits, with less than 0.4% relative loss for normal positive floats. Development judgments are from one observer; new ZIP wallpapers are unjudged. |

## Large-window ranking diagnostic

These accuracy calls use a separate result limit (1000). They help inspect the scoring formula and coverage. Do not pair this agreement with latency measured at the timed result limit (20), especially for approximate retrieval.

## Timed-search accuracy (first measured sample)

This quality view uses the first successful measured search per case at the same result limit (20) as the performance samples. It is not an average across repeated searches; approximate or nondeterministic methods may vary. Repeated raw trial results remain in diagnostics. Missing judged images are unassessed, so agreement must be read alongside pair and image coverage.

## Measured performance

Setup is measured separately. Latency percentiles pool measured query samples in this workload; inspect case details for slow queries. Warmup, cache control, repetitions and execution metadata are recorded above and below. Small sample counts do not establish stable tail latency.

## Resource observations

Harness CPU covers the measured block, including warmups. Memory values are process snapshots, not isolated candidate peaks; retained allocations from earlier candidates can affect them. Backend resources and index storage remain n/a when unmeasured. Scope and raw values are preserved in diagnostics.

## Favorite optimization: fused score: visual comparisons

This shows the large-window diagnostic ranking, not the separately measured timed-search result. Only judged examples appear in image comparisons. Submitted ties and partial orders are preserved; equal method scores are shown together. Unjudged retrieved IDs have no human preference label. Images load from the evaluation report server.
